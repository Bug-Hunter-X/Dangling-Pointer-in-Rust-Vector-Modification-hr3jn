This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: using a raw pointer to modify a vector after the vector's internal data has been reallocated.  The `bug.rs` file shows the erroneous code. `bugSolution.rs` provides a safe and corrected approach. This example highlights the importance of careful memory management in Rust, and the need to avoid situations where a raw pointer might outlive the data it points to.
